## Pull Requests

[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

Guidelines for pull requests:

- **Make your commit messages as descriptive as possible.** Include as much information as you can. Explain anything that the file diffs themselves won’t make apparent.

- **Document your pull request**. Explain your fix, link to the relevant issue, add screenshots when adding new icons.

- **Make sure the target of your pull request is the relevant branch**. Most of bugfix or new feature should go to the `main` branch.

- **Include only related work**. If your pull request has unrelated commit, it won't be accepted.

## Icon Guidelines

- **Icon names should be in kebab-case.** For example, `arrow-up` or `chevron-left`.

- **Icon names must be dentical to their lucide counterpart.**

- **Icons must be added as .svelte components.**

- **Icons must be added to the `src/lib/icons` directory.**

- **Only use vanilla CSS to create the animations.** No libraries like svelte-motion.
